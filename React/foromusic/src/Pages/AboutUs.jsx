               <h3>Our vision:</h3>
               <p>
                   We know that life is music. We honor life giving to it a little extra; reciving the rights vibrations by the best music.
                </p>
                <p>
                   We create a community that love they hear, so me connect to create a diccionary of albums that need to stay forever on ours thoughs.
                   So basicaly we invest on the construction of a big mind who enjoyed songs divectly from the human soul. Without any judgment we accept any 
                   taste for the sound itself. Expression is the force of our world and me walk because of all the people who let us enjoy that part that we all 
                   experience: The connetion itself of senses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We invite you to meet other worlds, create conections with others and with your newest self at any time.
